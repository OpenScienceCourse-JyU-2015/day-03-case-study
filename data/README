Data files for the case study: evolution of fish mitochondrial proteins

All data files were taken from the 2013 project folder
"2013-05_actinopterygii-mtDNA-evolution".

This file was originally compiled from information obtained from the fishbase
website (www.fishbase.org) during the year 2013.

Note that if one was to extract information from fishbase in 2016, it would be
much more efficient to use the R package rfishbase
(https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase).

Those files have been compiled from GenBank records retrieved in 2013, in an
attempt to gather all the complete actinopterygii mitochondrial genomes
available at that time.

All protein sequences were extracted from the GenBank records and compiled in
one file for each protein. There are 13 proteins encoded by the fish
mitochondrial DNA; only 3 are used in this case study.

- COI: cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
- cytB: cytochrome b
- ND5: NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 5
