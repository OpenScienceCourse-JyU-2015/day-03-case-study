Data files for the case study: evolution of fish mitochondrial proteins



------------------
fishbase_table.tsv
------------------

Data file(s) taken from the 2013 project folder
"2013-05_actinopterygii-mtDNA-evolution".

md5sum: b13d37a6186ccba48d0b244121dd4bbd

format: Tab-separated table with header

This file was originally compiled from information obtained from the fishbase
website (www.fishbase.org) during the year 2013.

Note that if one was to extract information from fishbase in 2016, it would be
much more efficient to use the R package rfishbase
(https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase).



-------------------------------------------------
fishbase_[temperature|environment|extra_data].tsv
-------------------------------------------------

md5sum: c2feb381a0a3d8cda9ecd961ffe98731  fishbase_environment.tsv
        0bfe42484378b569bb53b06b3dd72c7b  fishbase_extra_data.tsv
        cec93519f5bd9687a77f962305e69dd4  fishbase_temperature.tsv

format: Tab-separated tables with header

These tables were produced by splitting the original Fishbase table
'fishbase_table.tsv' into separate tables, with some column overlap, for
pedagogical purpose only. Row order is randomized in each new table.



-------------------
compilation_*.fasta
-------------------

Data file(s) taken from the 2013 project folder
"2013-05_actinopterygii-mtDNA-evolution".

md5sum: 26ed2e83361ee0409f908d22e1996bb1  compilation_COI.fasta
        276b3b992e8c5724fa46385b8de4c382  compilation_cytB.fasta
        caee562f14f679affb6e92e7787067aa  compilation_ND5.fasta

format: Fasta files

Those files have been compiled from GenBank records retrieved in 2013, in an
attempt to gather all the complete actinopterygii mitochondrial genomes
available at that time.

All protein sequences were extracted from the GenBank records and compiled in
one file for each protein. There are 13 proteins encoded by the fish
mitochondrial DNA; only 3 are used in this case study.

- COI: cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
- cytB: cytochrome b
- ND5: NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 5



-----------------
compilation_*.tsv
-----------------

md5sum: 617a719fc34bf4d1adabeff0e6e8dc25  compilation_COI.tsv
        a04987c9d5629aaf3d4a3a813c8c9f6d  compilation_cytB.tsv
        074bd92075af72c70ea5034da03d7365  compilation_ND5.tsv

format: Tab-separated table, with header

Those files were derived from the compilation_*.fasta files using the Python
script fasta2table.py, e.g.:

python fasta2table.py compilation_COI.fasta > compilation_COI.tsv



--------------------
fishbase_data.sqlite
--------------------

md5sum: fda4378da9b39643da0024aa378217f0

format: SQLite database

This file contains the information from the tab-separated tables
fishbase_[temperature|environment|extra_data].tsv and was produced by the
Python script tables2sqlite.py.



--------------------
aa_properties.sqlite
--------------------

md5sum: 3b5006d9423cee42c4fd89bdd1b5cbd6

format: SQLite database

This file contains some amino acid indices extracted from the aaindex1 database
release 9.1 (AUG 2006), as it was provided in the seqinr R package. The file
was produced by the R script makeAAtables.R.
