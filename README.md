This repository contains the data files required for the practicals of the Open
Science course held in Jyväskylä in Nov. 2016.

These files are used during the day 3 of the bootcamp, "A case study: fish
protein evolution".

See https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/courseMaterial for the
detailed material of the bootcamp.

# Data to use for day 03

*...and the story goes...*

Some of your colleagues have been gathering data from the public repositories
already (GenBank and FishBase), and have started to store it in a more or less
tidy format in sqlite databases.

Because your colleagues know how important it is to provide a full record of
how data is acquired and processed, they put everything into a
version-controlled repository.

Your task is to clone locally this repository and to use it as a starting point
for your own work.

The files you will be using to start with are:
- *fishbase_data.sqlite*
- *aa_properties.sqlite*
